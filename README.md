# kNearPrototype
This project demonstrates the [kNear](https://github.com/NathanEpstein/kNear) library by clustering colors in groups, using [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) for the view part.
It was created as a prototype/proof of concept for a project.

The autoplay function generates random input, but it is also possible to add separate steps.
